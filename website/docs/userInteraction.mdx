## Items Selection

There two types of items that can be selected at this moment, node and link. This can be done by clicking or touching them.
For multiselection you have two options:

1. Tap and hold for a moment.
2. Click primary mouse button while holding `multiselectionKey`, this key is by default `shift`, but can also be configurated to `ctrl`, `meta` and `alt`. For example:

```jsx
<Diagram
  settings={{
    diagram: {
      userInteraction: {
        multiselectionKey: 'meta',
      },
    },
  }}
/>
```
